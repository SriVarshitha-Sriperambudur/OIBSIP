Oasis Infobyte Internship - Java Programming Tasks
Overview
Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte internship program! This README provides an overview of the Java programming tasks assigned during the internship.
Please read through the tasks carefully and ensure that you understand the requirements before proceeding.

Tasks
  >Data Structure Implementation
    Implement a binary search tree (BST) data structure in Java. The BST should support insertion, deletion, and searching operations.
      Requirements:
        The BST implementation should handle generic data types.
        Implement methods for insertion, deletion, and searching.
        Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.

  >Algorithm Implementation
    Implement the QuickSort algorithm in Java.
       Requirements:
        The implementation should be able to sort arrays of integers.
        Ensure that the algorithm works correctly for arrays of varying sizes.
        Write unit tests to validate the correctness and efficiency of your implementation.
